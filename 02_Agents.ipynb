            "  \"description\": \"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A key feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of 'this' or 'self'). Thus, OOP views a program as a collection of interacting objects.\",\n",

It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components (data hiding), usually with 'private' or 'protected' access modifiers. This protects the data from being accidentally modified and ensures data integrity.\",\n",

It automatically gets all the attributes and methods of the 'Car' class (like 'color', 'make', 'model', 'accelerate()', 'brake()'), and can add its own unique attributes and methods (like 'spoiler', 'turboBoost()').

This enables writing code that can work with objects of different types without needing to know their specific class.  Two common types are method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding (subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass).\",\n",

When we call 'displayInfo()' on a 'Car' object, it will display car-specific information; when we call it on a 'Truck' object, it will display truck-specific information.  Even though the method name is the same, the behavior is different based on the object type.\"\n",
