            "\n",
            "1.  **Joke:** Aik admi ne sign board par likha: \"Kutte se hoshiyar.\" Dusre admi ne uske neeche likha: \"Kutta bhi tumse hoshiyar.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "    **Translation:** A man wrote on a sign board: \"Beware of the dog.\" Another man wrote underneath: \"The dog is also beware of you.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "    **Humor:** This is a play on words and a bit of sarcasm. The second man is implying the dog is just as wary of the first man as the first man is wary of the dog.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Joke:** Teacher: \"Woh kaunsa parinda hai jo ud nahin sakta?\" Student: \"Mara hua parinda.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "    **Translation:** Teacher: \"Which bird cannot fly?\" Student: \"A dead bird.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "    **Humor:**  This is a simple, literal answer to a seemingly clever question. The student takes the question at face value, providing an obvious but funny answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Joke:** Aik admi bike se jaa raha tha. Police wale ne roka aur kaha, \"Helmet kahan hai?\" Admi bola, \"Jee, kal hi toh sar dhulwaya tha!\"\n",
            "\n",
            "    **Translation:** A man was going on a bike. A policeman stopped him and said, \"Where's your helmet?\" The man said, \"Sir, I just washed my hair yesterday!\"\n",
            "\n",
            "    **Humor:** This is a joke based on misunderstanding. The man deliberately misinterprets the policeman's question about the helmet (for safety) as a question about his hair.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Joke:** Pathan bus mein safar kar raha tha.  Kandaktor ne kaha: \"Paisa lao.\" Pathan ne kaha: \"Paisa to ham ghar pe chhod aye.\" Kandaktor: \"To utar jao.\" Pathan: \"Kya matlab? Hum paisa ghar pe bhool gaye to kya bus bhi ghar pe chhod aye?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "    **Translation:** A Pathan was traveling on a bus. The conductor said: \"Pay the fare.\" The Pathan said: \"I left the money at home.\" Conductor: \"Then get off.\" Pathan: \"What do you mean? Just because I forgot the money at home, does that mean I left the bus at home too?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "    **Humor:**  This joke plays on the stereotype of Pathans as being simple or foolish. The Pathan feigns ignorance and pretends to misunderstand the situation, twisting the conductor's words.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Joke:** Judge: Tumne police officer ko laat kyun maari?\n",
            "    Accused: Maine nahi maari huzoor! Wo to khud hi fisal gaya tha mere paon se.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "    **Humor:** This is a humorous denial of guilt, using a ridiculous excuse. The accused claims the officer accidentally slipped on his foot, which is an obviously improbable and funny explanation.\n"
